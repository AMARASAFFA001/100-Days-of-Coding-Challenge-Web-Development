Web Development 100 Days: A Beginner's Journey

Day 1-Day 2: Introduction to Web Development
Today, I embarked on my 100 Days of Coding Challenge with a focus on web development. Here's a explaination of what I've learned:

What is Web Development?
Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites. It encompasses both the front-end (user interface) and back-end (server-side) development.

Key Concepts:
HTML (HyperText Markup Language): Used for structuring content on the web. Elements like <head>, <body>, and <p> help create the layout of a page.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Styles and beautifies HTML elements. Selectors and properties like color, font-size, and margin control the appearance.
JavaScript: Adds interactivity to websites. Functions, variables, and event listeners allow for dynamic user experiences.
The Web's Infrastructure:

URL (Uniform Resource Locator): An address for resources on the web. Consists of the protocol (https://), domain (example.com), and path (/page).
Browser: Software that interprets and displays web content. Popular browsers include Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
Internet Basics: Data transfer between a client (your device) and a server. The client requests resources, and the server responds.
Behind the Scenes:

DNS (Domain Name System): Translates human-readable domain names (like example.com) to IP addresses.
Server: A computer that stores and serves web content. Handles requests from clients.
HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure): Ensures secure data transfer between the client and server.
